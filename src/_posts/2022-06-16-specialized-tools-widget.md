The Specialized Tool Widget is responsible for tracking and displaying your specialized tool (or mantles) cooldown and timers. HunterPie offers two different modes for the Specialized Tool Widget:

- Compact Mode;
- Detailed Mode;

## Compact Mode

This mode is for people who are only interested in the timer and cooldown of their tools.

## Detailed Mode

Besides the information that compact mode also shows you, detailed mode also shows the name of the specialized tool.
