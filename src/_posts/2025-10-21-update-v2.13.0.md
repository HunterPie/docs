## Theme System Overhaul

Starting with v2.13, HunterPie will have a new theming system. This new system is built with 2 key principles in mind:

#### A better experience to users

There is now a new UI that allows the user to toggle, manage and order the themes to define a load priority. That means it is now possible to have **multiple** themes enabled at the same time.

#### A better experience to developers

With the new system, it is now possible to have hot-reloading, allowing theme developers to test and see the results in real-time, without having to restart the whole application. This applies to both the client and also the overlay!

> There are still some limitations on the hot-reloading support, but it shouldn't be an issue to 99% of the cases.

## Color Schemes

With the introdution of the new theme system, there has also been a change on HunterPie's client color scheme. This change doesn't affect the overlay in any way, it was mostly to make the client itself more consistent keeping only 3 foreground colors and 3 background colors. 

## Settings

- Added conditional settings, that means that settings that dependends on other settings to be enabled, will be hidden if their dependencies' conditions are not met.
