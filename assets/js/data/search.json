This new system is built with 2 key principles in mind:A better experience to usersThere is now a new UI that allows the user to toggle, manage and order the themes to define a load priority. That means it is now possible to have multiple themes enabled at the same time.A better experience to developersWith the new system, it is now possible to have hot-reloading, allowing theme developers to test and see the results in real-time, without having to restart the whole application. This applies to both the client and also the overlay! There are still some limitations on the hot-reloading support, but it shouldn’t be an issue to 99% of the cases.Color SchemesWith the introdution of the new theme system, there has also been a change on HunterPie’s client color scheme. This change doesn’t affect the overlay in any way, it was mostly to make the client itself more consistent keeping only 3 foreground colors and 3 background colors.Settings Added conditional settings, that means that settings that dependends on other settings to be enabled, will be hidden if their dependencies’ conditions are not met.OverlayActivities Widget Added support to Monster Hunter Wilds activities. Design overhaul of the widget for every supported game.Specialized Tool Widget Added support to Monster Hunter Wilds mantles. Design overhaul of the widget. It is now possible to choose between compact or detailed mode for the widget. compact mode detailed modeClock Widget Added Moon Phases tracking for Monster Hunter Wilds.Damage Meter Widget HunterPie is now able to track supporter hunters damage. Added setting that allows the user to hide every party member other than themselves.Abnormalities Widget Added support to critical draw and power stone buffs.

The thing is, messing with closed source software isn’t really straightforward, depending on how a process was compiled and which language it was made on, the human readable part code is completely removed from the binaries, you won’t have the class, structs, function and method names, it will be just a bunch of bytes, offsets and instructions.This article will be split up into 2 topics, the reverse engineering and HunterPie’s architecture.The Reverse EngineeringReverse engineering is an arduous and time consuming, although fun, process. A big part of it is to assume things, I’m not a game developer myself but as a software engineer you can have a pretty good idea on how things are implemented.For instance, what is the first thing that comes in mind when you think of a health value? Probably a number, those can be usually implemented using integers or floating point decimals, in the case of Monster Hunter World, that was implemented using a float type.It is important to note that in order to assume things, you also need to understand the basics of data types and data structures. For example, how would the following data structure look like in memory in a x64 game?struct Player { float health; float maxHealth; char* name;};It would look like the following:The other important part of reverse engineering is to understand at least the basics of what happens when a program is compiled down to native machine code, what is the stack memory? The heap? If you wrote a code that access a field in a class, what would that look like in assembly? All that is important to know before diving into how HunterPie works exactly and I’ll be explaining those concepts since they’re really important.Types, Structures &amp;amp; ClassesMonster Hunter World is written in C++ and follows the OOP concepts, which means there are a lot of abstract classes, inheritance, etc.TypesMemory is just a contiguous and really big array bytes, knowing all the primitive types is really helpful because that’s how you’re going to be able to map the structures by hand, for instance, the following little endian hex value 00 00 80 3F is the float32 value for 1.0, but if you tried to read it as an int, it would represent 1065353216. Depending on how you read the bytes or how many bytes you are reading the value can change drastically. When I look at the memory, deducing the type I’m working with is very contextual.There are a couple of things you can look for when trying to figure out which types you’re looking at, for example, when you’re working with a float or double, those are usually stored in floating point registers (xmm0, xmm1, etc) or handled by floating point instructions like the movss. On the other hand, integers are usually stored in the QWORD registers (rax, rbx, etc).StructuresYou can think of a structure as a little box of primitive types, when you’re looking at memory you won’t be able to tell how many fields there are, or where a field starts or ends, that’s when putting breakpoints on the memory addresses with a debugger come useful. It allows you to see which instructions access that given memory address, here’s a simple example:movss xmm0, [eax]mov rbx, [rax+4]movss xmm1, [ebx]When looking at the previous two instructions, we can tell that rax is an structure and it has two fields, the first field is mostly likely afloat since it’s being put in a float register, the second one is a pointer since it’s being dereferenced with the offset 4, the pointer also points to another structure with a float. You could represent that as:struct RBX { float value;};struct RAX { float value; RBX* rbx;};ClassesAn easy way to think of classes in memory is to think of a struct, and the methods as functions where the first parameter is a reference to that struct. Consider the following class:class Player { public: float GetHealth() { return this-&amp;gt;m_health; } char* GetName() { return this-&amp;gt;m_name; } private: float m_health; float m_maxHealth; char* m_name;}It’s safe to say that if you compiled the previous class and wanted to “transpile” the assembly code to something more human readable, it would look something like this:struct Player { float health; float maxHealth; char* name;};float GetHealth(Player* player) { return player-&amp;gt;health;}char* GetName(Player* player) { return player-&amp;gt;name;}It’s good to know these type of things because when you’re reverse engineering a procedure in assembly, if the first parameter is an 8 byte long value that is often dereferenced with offsets, there’s a pretty big chance that procedure is an implementation of a method for that given pointer, and that helps a lot when trying to understand what that procedure does.In the case of virtual functions, things change a little bit and get more complicated, a table will be created for that class and a pointer to that table will be the first field in the structure, this was very common in Monster Hunter World, as every monster had it’s own class but they all inherited a common enemy class with virtual methods. The same class Player could be represented like this if it implemented virtual functions:struct Player { void* vptr; float health; float maxHealth; char* name;}Although the vtable is generated automatically by the compiler, the dereference and calls are done in runtime, so unlike non-virtual functions that are called by their already-known relative address, virtual functions need to be dereferenced and put into a register before being called, which makes it fairly easy to tell when you’re dealing with a virtual function.; Assuming rax is a Player*mov rbx, [rax] ; Puts the value of vptr into the rbx registermov rdx, [rbx] ; Puts the pointer to the virtual function into the rdx registercall rdx ; Calls the virtual functionMemoryThe process’s memory can be split up in two, the static memory and the dynamic memory. The static memory is the one that is embedded in the executable itself, the compiler is the one responsible for this one, this memory is where global and static variables are, this is very important because that’s how HunterPie (and the software itself) get to the values in the dynamic memory. The memory addresses in the static memory are always the same, unless you change something internally in the code and recompile your program.The dynamic memory on the other hand is well… Dynamic! The addresses are never the same, those are handled by the OS in runtime whenever your software needs more memory. The heap and the stack are also part of the dynamic memory, whenever you use the keyword new or use the malloc function, it will reserve some space in the memory and give you a pointer to that address, and for local variables the stack will be used for primitive types.The thing is, you can get to anything in the dynamic memory from the static memory, you just need the right offsets to get to your desired data, and that’s the tricky part. The process of finding the offsets from the static memory to the value you want is done backwards; First you find the value you want by scanning the dynamic memory with possible values (this is where assuming things come in) and then you put a breakpoint on the accessors of that value and look at what which instructions accesses them.Consider the following image:Let’s say the value you found is the second field in the Structure 3, the int one, when you put a breakpoint on it, you might get an instruction accessing a register plus the offset 4, something like this:mov ebx, [eax+4] ; The instruction and registers might differThat means the base address of our structure is 0x1004 - 4 = 0x1000, with that value you can now scan for all addresses that contains the value 0x1000, that will give you a list of all possible Structure 3 pointers.You can now put a breakpoint on that pointer and see the instructions, that access it, it should be something like:mov rbx, [rax+14h]By doing the same process you did previously, you’ll find the static memory, now you can always get to the Structure 3’s desired field by following that “path” of offsets, you just need to dereference the static address with the offsets you found:Static Memory -&amp;gt; (Structure 1 + 0x14) -&amp;gt; (Structure 3 + 0x4) -&amp;gt; Desired field Dereferencing the memory values from the static memory is HunterPie’s main way to extract the data from the game, it is constantly reading the game’s memory and updating the values internally.DLL InjectionSometimes you want to access the process’s data that is not in memory, in Monster Hunter Rise, for example, the player’s damage is not stored in memory, so scanning the memory for them is not possible.One of HunterPie’s core feature is to be able to track and plot the player’s damage on screen, for that to work properly I had to use another technique. Code injection and function hooks!InjectionThere are a couple of ways to inject code into other processes, but the easiest is to use Window’s kernel32. It has some very useful functions that can be used for this purpose: Open a handle to another process (OpenProcess) Allocate memory in another process (VirtualAllocEx) Write to another process’s memory (WriteProcessMemory) Load library from a path (LoadLibraryW) Create threads in another process (CreateRemoteThread)These 5 steps allow you to inject a library, you start by opening a process handle, allocating enough memory to be able to write a path to your DLL file, writing the string, finding the remote process’s LoadLibraryW address and then creating a remote thread using that LoadLibraryW as start address and the injected string as a parameter.That will make the remote process load the library you want.Function HooksFunction hooks, also known as trampoline or detouring, is a very useful technique to make a process execute code whenever a built-in function is called. If you’re interested on details on this one, take a look at MinHook.Basically it replace the first couple instructions from a procedure with a jmp instruction pointing to a relative address to where your function is, and then another jmp on your detoured function to jump back to the original instructions.This technique allows you to execute code that receives the same parameters as the original function or even change behavior of the original function.HunterPieNow that you’ve seen the basics on how to extract values from another process, it’s easier to explain HunterPie’s architecture.The application is split up in 4 modules: Core, UI, Integrations and HunterPie itself. Core: Contains the application domain entities, this includes common interfaces, configuration definitions, event models, and services that can be used by other modules. Integrations: This is the module that handles the logic for scanning each game, it’s responsible for implementing the interfaces that are on Core. UI: As the name implies, it’s the module responsible for UI related things such as visual controls, data converters, views and view models. The UI module is agnostic to the game integrations which makes the overlay components fully reusable independently of the game. HunterPie: This is the program itself, it is responsible to initialize all the other modules and handle internal features.HunterPie follows an event-based architecture model, there are events for everything that have the possibility of changing. Whenever you start a supported game, a new IContext is instantiated, that interface contains ways to access player, enemies and also game data through the IPlayer, IMonster and IGame interfaces.The previous interfaces are responsible for update values internally and also dispatch events for those values.For example, to start receiving events of the player’s level, you can just subscribe to the OnLevelChange event.[...]private void SubscribeToEvents(IContext context){ context.Game.Player.OnLevelChange += (source, args) =&amp;gt; { Log.Info($&quot;The player is now level {args.MasterRank}&quot;); }}[...]Whenever HunterPie detect that the player’s level changed in-game, it will update the internal value in the IPlayer class and dispatch the event to all its subscribers.Detecting values changesHunterPie tracks values using two different approaches, the first one is by constantly scanning the game’s memory for static addresses and offset paths to the data it needs to works. The second one is by injecting a native library inside the game and opening a communication layer between HunterPie and the game.Memory scanningEvery supported game has a map file containing addresses and offsets that can be used, the map file looks something like this and is loaded in runtime whenever the game starts.# AddressesAddress QUEST_DATA_ADDRESS 0x506F240# OffsetsOffset QUEST_STATE_OFFSETS 0x54 # This supports an array of integers tooThen in the scanner implementation you can fetch those values and read the memory with any type you want, this includes reading complex structures to reduce the amount of P/Invoke calls when reading multiple values.[ScannableMethod]private void GetQuestState(){ var questState = (QuestState)Memory.Deref&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;( AddressMap.GetAbsolute(&quot;QUEST_DATA_ADDRESS&quot;), AddressMap.Get&amp;lt;int[]&amp;gt;(&quot;QUEST_STATE_OFFSETS&quot;) ); QuestStatus = questState.ToStatus(); IsInQuest = questState == QuestState.InQuest;}The ScannableMethod attribute on top of the method name allows that method to be automatically injected into HunterPie’s ScanManager, the scan manager will run all scannable methods in a background thread every couple milliseconds (this can be configured by the user). It also handles failures and has an internal “circuit-breaker” strategy to remove troublesome scannables if they fail too often.Handling failures is a mandatory thing, sometimes process pointers are not valid anymore and HunterPie can read garbage values that could cause a crash if not handled correctly.Native InterfaceThe second value tracking strategy is through a native interface, first HunterPie injects a statically linked library into the game. Once this library is loaded, it automatically opens a TCP socket server that starts listening for incoming connections from HunterPie.To exchange data between the HunterPie application (made in C#) with HunterPie’s native interface that is injected into the game (made in C++), they use a binary protocol, the messages look like this:namespace Core::Server::Models{ typedef uint32_t IPCMessageVersion; enum IPCMessageType { INIT_IPC_MEMORY_ADDRESSES, INIT_MH_HOOKS, GET_HUNT_STATISTICS, DELETE_HUNT_STATISTICS, CLEAR_HUNT_STATISTICS, UNKNOWN }; struct IPCMessage { IPCMessageType type; IPCMessageVersion version; };}Every message will receive the IPCMessage structure as its first field, allowing HunterPie to call the right MessageHandler based on the IPCMessageType and IPCMessageVersion.The OverlayThe overlay is one of HunterPie’s main features and is also the most used one, the architecture is very similar to Model View ViewModel (MVVM) pattern but instead of having a “Model”, HunterPie has what I call IContextHandler. The Views is responsible for the UI itself, it’s what the user will visualize; The ViewModel is responsible to control the data the View will display through data bindings; The IContextHandler is the one responsible to subscribe and handle HunterPie game context’s events. It has direct access to both the View and to the ViewModel it is controlling, but they cannot see the IContextHandler.This architecture makes it really easy to test how the UI is behaving since we can easily create a mock the IContext and simulate in-game changes.The overlay is composed by Widgets, each Widget has its own scope and responsibility, you can have the Monster Widget, that is responsible to display Monster’s information, the Damage Meter Widget that displays the damage done by the players in your party, the Abnormalities Widget that tracks and displays your buffs and debuffs timers, and so on.Every Widget is agnostic to what game you are playing, so it doesn’t matter whether you’re playing Monster Hunter World or Monster Hunter Rise, the Widget components will be reused for both games.Hunt ExportsAnother cool feature, although very recent, is the ability to export hunts. Since HunterPie is constantly tracking in-game information, it is able to track vital information to build a history graph of what happened in your game session.It displays the party members, their damage over time and the (de)buff uptimes. This is possible because since HunterPie follows an event-based architecture, it can “recreate” what happened in-game based on the order that HunterPie’s internal events were dispatched!At the end of every hunt, HunterPie will automatically serialize that data and upload it to HunterPie’s backend and link the upload to the user’s account.ConclusionsHunterPie has been released 4 years ago, the current architecture was very different years ago and is the result to solve solutions I had in the past due to a not well-thought-of architecture. It also took me years to learn things I know now about reverse engineering now, but one thing I can say is that the process of learning all of it was very fun, interesting and changed the way I see software engineering nowadays." }, { "title": "HunterPie v2.8.0", "url": "/posts/update-v2.8.0/", "categories": "Update, v2", "tags": "", "date": "2023-04-19 13:54:00 +0800", "snippet": " If you enjoy HunterPie and want to support its development, consider supporting on Patreon!

Despite those, I learned a lot while developing it and used a lot of the fundamentals to implement the next iteration of HunterPie.After some time working on HunterPy, I had a simple overlay working pretty alright, all it had was monster health bars but it was enough to get some friends to use it and test it for me. HunterPy user interfaceSome key features that I always wanted to keep were: Discord Rich Presence The overlay A console Settings that you could interact with, instead of a configuration.json fileOne of the problems with making windows with Python is that you can’t just compile the whole software into a single executable due to how Python works, there are some solutions but they generate a bunch of extra files or huge binaries that would be really painful to distribute if I ever wanted other people to use it.That’s when I decided to rewrite everything in another language, something I could compile and just distribute in a nice little package without worrying too much about the package size.The first iteration…The reason why HunterPie is called HunterPie is because it didn’t make sense to keep the Py suffix anymore as the application was no longer being developed in Python, but I really liked how HunterPy sounded, so I just changed the suffix to keep the same sound without making a reference to Python.The next iteration of HunterPie’s user interface looked like this: HunterPie v1 alpha client HunterPie v1 alpha client settingsThe monster widget looked like this: HunterPie v1 alpha Monster WidgetThis iteration had not only the monster health bar, but also the Harvest Box tracker and Specialized Tool trackers.…the next iteration…The next iteration happened 4 months after the first release of HunterPie v1.0.0.0. I learned a lot more about the UI framework I was using and completely designed the client, not only that but I also created my own UI components for the settings window. This next iteration also had more features like: full localization support so other people could localize HunterPie to their languages; a damage meter widget and the abnormalities tracker widget. HunterPie v1 client HunterPie v1 client settingsThe two main widgets of HunterPie looked like this: HunterPie v1 Monster Widget HunterPie v1 Damage Meter WidgetThe design for the Damage Meter was inspired by Shinra Meter, a TERA damage meter overlay that I used a lot when playing the game back in the days.…and the last iterationThe last iteration of HunterPie v1 happened a few months after the previous one, at that point HunterPie had many new features, new widgets for the overlay, it could export the player’s current build to Honey Hunters, export all the charms and decorations your character had, it also had plugins support, HunterPie Native was also a thing, a way that HunterPie was able to communicate directly with the game which allowed many pretty cool things to happen.In this iteration the design structure of the client didn’t change much, but the colors and the settings page did.I wanted a cleaner design for the client, and changing the colors to a baby blue instead of red made things look more modern and less aggressive, not only the accent color changed but HunterPie’s logo also changed to be white instead of red. HunterPie v1 last iteration clientAdding a blur effect to the background also made the client to look more modern, similar to Window’s native acryllic effect.As for the settings page, having every setting in a single component was getting way too cluttered and messy, so I added different tabs for each one of the features, the settings were also aligned in a way so the setting label would be anchored to the left and the actual control for that setting would be on the right-most side, that was a way to solve the weird alignment of the previous iteration. HunterPie v1 last iteration client settingsThe main widgets design also changed, the Monster Widget had another design overhaul to look more simple and modern: HunterPie v1 last iteration Monster WidgetAnd the damage meter got a damage graph! HunterPie v1 last iteration Damage Meter WidgetHunterPie v2The reason why I started rewriting HunterPie from scratch to what would become v2 is because its predecessor had a really messy code base, it got to a point where adding new features was really hard and adding support for the upcoming game (Monster Hunter Rise) would be actually impossible. Everything in v1 was heavily tied to Monster Hunter World, not only that but the whole UI was strongly tied to HunterPie’s core code.So for v2 I decided to fix some issues legacy had: The client UI had to look more modern and clean: I don’t think legacy’s UI was bad, but I don’t think it was great either. The settings page to be generated automatically: This is one of legacy’s biggest issues for me as a developer, everytime I added new settings I had to also create the UI components for it manually. The settings should be saved automatically on change: Legacy couldn’t detect if the settings were changed, so the user had to click on the Save button everytime they made changes. Support any Monster Hunter game: Legacy could only support Monster Hunter World. Write the code in a way that Core code is separate from the UI code: Legacy code didn’t have this distinction, core code could access the UI’d and vice-versa.I will explain each one of those points and how I solved them in a later post, but here’s the result: HunterPie v2 clientThe first thing you can notice is how the colors are much more consistent, they make sense together, it’s no longer a mix of warm and cold colors. The icons are also perfectly aligned now, and they’re all consistent and match the rest of the UI.As for the settings window, I kept the same idea and structure of its predecessor, however it is now possible to search for settings by their label. HunterPie v2 is also capable of automatically saving the settings whenever something changes, so there’s no need for a Save button anymore. HunterPie v2 client settingsNow for the two most used overlay widget, the monster widget got a design overhaul to match the rest of the client UI, in fact, all widgets have gotten a design overhaul to make the UI consistent amongst themselves: HunterPie v2 Monster WidgetAnd the damage meter had a lot of UI improvements too: HunterPie v2 Damage Meter WidgetFinal ConsiderationsThere were a lot of enhancements to HunterPie’s user interface throghout time, most of the things were just trial and error, see what works and what does not. Some came with time and experience after I started working as a software engineer and started having more contact with real world software.The user interface is just the tip of the iceberg for HunterPie, there’s a lot going on behind it, a lot of time and effort put into researching the games, designing and coding HunterPie’s UI, coding internal things used in the core of HunterPie, coding the native part that is required for some features, coding the backend, maintaining all the infrastructure, etc.And of course, each one of those individual pieces that make HunterPie work the way it does deserve their own post. Fun fact: I have spent +2,1K hours on HunterPie (Client and Server) and a couple hundred hours reverse engineering both Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise.

This value is synchronized with every party member, which means it is the most accurate value possible and everyone in the party will receive the actual damage each party member dealt. The limitation is that it: Only works in normal quests, arena quests do not count. The value will be updated only once every 5 seconds for remote players and in real time for the local player. As a fallback, if there is no accurate damage value available, the not-as-accurate value will be used. This value is always calculated by your game regardless if you’re the host or not, and since it is not synced amongst party members, the value can have some inconsistencies when comparing to the meter of other players.In both cases, your own damage is always accurate. Only damage coming directly from weapons are accounted for, this is how the game handle these damage calculations. HunterPie DOES NOT calculate anything, it just displays the values that your game calculates.Monster Hunter WorldThe damage for World is calculated by the game itself, it is the same damage that is used in the quest awards screen (after finishing the quest). Since this is a value synced with every player in the party, the damage for each player will be the same regardless if you’re the host or not.In the case of expeditions, guiding lands and missions that have no target (Kulve Taroth Siege), the damage is not tracked by the game, HunterPie will use its fallback implementation. The fallback can only track the local player’s damage, this is a game limitation.Monster Hunter RiseTo calculate the damage for Monster Hunter Rise, HunterPie will sum every hit damage and assign it to whoever did the damage. This does not consider: Environmental damage Damage done by ailments (e.g: poison, blast) Damage done by other monsters Hitting a dead monster will still count as damage done to a monster. This is a known issue and will be fixed eventually.SettingsPlayer colorsYou can change yours and your party members color by going to the settings tab and clicking on the color configuration.Damage plotMoving Average DPSHunterPie will display the moving average DPS by default, the moving average is more useful than the overall DPS plotting because the overall DPS tends to stabilize in the long run. moving average DPS vs Overall DPSIt is highly recommended to use the moving average, however it is also possible to toggle it off and plot either overall DPS or total damage. Changing the plot mode while in a hunt will not update the previous points that were already plotted in the graph.DPS CalculationBy default, HunterPie will calculate the damage per second based on the quest timer, however, this can be inaccurate especially when joining in-progress quests (such as SOSes), you can change the DPS calculation strategy in the Damage Meter settings. Strategy Description Relative to quest The quest timer will be used to calculate players DPS Relative to join The time when each player joined the quest will be subtracted from the quest timer when calculating players DPS Relative to first hit The time when each player hit a monster for the first time will be subtracted from the quest timer when calculating players DPS " }, { "title": "HunterPie v2.0.23", "url": "/posts/update-v2.0.23/", "categories": "Update, v2", "tags": "", "date": "2022-05-02 03:51:00 +0800", "snippet": "HunterPie v2.0.23 contains the first part of the full Monster Hunter World support.General Changed Mount ailment name to Ride for Monster Hunter Rise Changed visual component for hotkeys Changed visuals of ComboBox Changed HunterPie client color scheme to be more consistent Added Offensive Guard abnormality for Monster Hunter RiseConfigurationSince HunterPie can support multiple games, it allows you to configure games separately, so you can have a different overlay configuration for each game.Choosing which game to configure is rather simple, just choose the game by its name in the box in the bottom of HunterPie’s settings window.Monster Hunter: WorldOne of the main reasons HunterPie v2 exists is to support multiple games from the Monster Hunter series, this update brings support for Monster Hunter: World and some of the main overlay Widgets that v1 has at the moment.OverlayMonster WidgetCompared to HunterPie legacy, the monster widget now has 100% accurate lockon detection, supports more than 3 monsters.

If you don’t rename it, there’s a risk your local file will be overwritten during the auto-update process.Do not touch the first line of the XML Document, that is telling our XML parser the version and file encoding we are using. It should ALWAYS be the first line of the file and should always look like this:&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- Comments can be added ONLY after the tag --&amp;gt;Next step is to set the language name, you can do it in the next Tag by changing the value of the lang attribute.&amp;lt;!-- Before --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Strings lang=&quot;English&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- After --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Strings lang=&quot;Japanese&quot;&amp;gt;Now we’re can translate the rest of the file, most localization Tags have three attributes: Id: Used internally by HunterPie to query the string and description. DO NOT TOUCH THIS VALUE String: The actual string that will be shown in HunterPie’s interface. Description: This one is only used in places where there can be a tooltip, e.g: Settings, Buttons Please, try to keep all translations as accurate as possible with the in-game strings (especially abnormalities and monster names). You can shorten long strings as long as they don’t become difficult to understand.E.g:&amp;lt;!-- Before --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Rise&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;0&quot; String=&quot;Rathian&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;1&quot; String=&quot;Apex Rathian&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;2&quot; String=&quot;Rathalos&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;3&quot; String=&quot;Apex Rathalos&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;4&quot; String=&quot;Khezu&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;5&quot; String=&quot;Basarios&quot;/&amp;gt; [...]&amp;lt;!-- After --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Rise&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;0&quot; String=&quot;リオレイア&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;1&quot; String=&quot;ヌシ・リオレイア&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;2&quot; String=&quot;リオレウス&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;3&quot; String=&quot;ヌシ・リオレウス&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;4&quot; String=&quot;フルフル&quot;/&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Monster Id=&quot;5&quot; String=&quot;バサルモス&quot;/&amp;gt; [...]XML Special CharactersXML has some characters that should be replaced by their escaped versions in order for it to work. This is because these characters are used in the XML’s structure itself, and the parser has a hard time figuring out whether it’s a XML character or if it’s just a normal character.

This will hide the Widget but the Widget will still be created everytime you open the game. If you don’t care about a certain widget at all, it is recommended to turn the Initialize Widget option off. This will make it so that Widget won’t be created at all.Adjusting positions and scalesIt is possible to change the Widget’s position, scale and opacity. Position: You can change the values of the X and Y coordinates for the widgets, note that since it uses absolute position, if you set them to something out of boundaries, the widget will also be out of boundaries and will not be visible anymore. Opacity: This option controls the transparency of the whole widget, the values range from 0 to 1 where 0 is 0% visible and 1 is 100% visible. Scale: This controls the vertical and horizontal scale of the Widget, the values range from 0.1 to 2 where 0.1 is 10% of the original size and 2 is 200% of the original size. Although it is possible to change the position and scale directly from the settings tab, it is recommended to do that in the design mode.Dynamic BehaviorsHunterPie provides a way where the Widgets will hide themselves whenever the game’s HUD is visible.

Their visual representation depends on what type of part it is: Color Represents Description Flinch Flinch values represent when the monster is going to flinch or get staggered. Break Break values represent when a part is about to break. Sever Severable parts are the ones that can be cut off from a monster. Broken A part will become Grey when it’s either broken or severed. Qurio* A part will become Pink when it’s related to the monster’s Qurio state. When a part has all three values, the priority order is always Qurio &amp;gt; Sever &amp;gt; Break &amp;gt; Flinch and the exact values displayed under the part health bar will follow that priority. By default, HunterPie only shows monsters’s parts when you lock/focus on the monster using the in-game lock-on system. A Qurio part is exclusive for Monster Hunter Rise: SunbreakMonster AilmentsAilments are statuses and debuffs you can inflict on a monster, HunterPie supports all of them, however, some of them might display as Unknown since ailments are mapped manually and require testing.They’re designed to be as simple to read as possible, displaying Build Up, Duration and also how many times that Ailment has been activated on that monster. Each ailment has it’s own individual color to make it easier to know what ailment has been inflicted without having to read it’s name. By default, HunterPie only shows monsters’s ailments when you lock/focus on the monster using the in-game lock-on system.Targeting a monsterHaving to target a monster to see their information is part of HunterPie’s design to avoid cluttering the screen with multiple monsters information, to target a monster, all you need to do is use the in-game lock-on system. If you have targeting system disabled in-game, this will not work. You must have either Target or Focus enabled.Capture indicatorFor capturable monsters, an upside down triangle () will be placed on the exact percentage where the monster will become capturable.
